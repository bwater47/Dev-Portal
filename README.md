# Dev-Portal
![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)
- Tech blog site for Web Developers to connect by reading posts from other Developers, and writing their own!

## Description

- My motivation for building this application was to provide a friendly tech blog site for web developers to compare their ideas and write about new technologies. I wanted to create a platform that fosters growth and collaboration in the developer community without the distraction of advertisements.
- This project was built to offer a tech blog website free of advertisements, promoting a focused and uninterrupted experience for users. It aims to create a supportive environment where developers can share their insights, learn from one another, and stay updated on the latest technological advancements shared by others.
- This solves the problem of not having an open-source application that allows web developers to share their ideas across the board. Many existing platforms are either cluttered with ads or lack the collaborative features needed by the developer community. This application provides a clean, open-source alternative that encourages knowledge sharing and professional growth.
- In this project, I learned that using the MVC architectural template with Handlebars for templating, Sequelize for the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication allows for the creation of a CMS-style blog site similar to WordPress. I also learned how to implement authentication for login and logout processes, which ensures that users can securely access the main content of the website when logged in and are redirected to the login page when not authenticated. This combination of technologies and features enabled me to build a robust and user-friendly platform for web developers.

## Installation

You'll need to install GitBash, VS Code, Node.js, and run NPM Install for the dependencies. From here you will need knowledge on how to clone a repo from GitHub over to your device to store it locally. Once its stored locally on your device you can open VSCode. Lastly once VSCode is running open the CLI (Command-Line-Interface), type npm install for the node_modules packages, establish the database using postgreSQL, and then run the server using NPM run dev. Once you've done this the website can be deployed locally for testing, debugging, and developing.

## Usage

The Dev Portal is important for Web Developers. They spend their time reading and writing about technical concepts. This blog site is a place for developers to write their own blogs on technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies.
